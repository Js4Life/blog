Angular version **6.1** has been [released](https://blog.angular.io/angular-v6-1-now-available-typescript-2-9-scroll-positioning-and-more-9f1c03007bb6) and itâ€™s shipped with a new useful pipeâ€Šâ€”â€Š`KeyValuePipe`Â .

As you probably know, the `ngFor` directive doesnâ€™t support iterations over objects or Maps. But there are many times when we need this kind of functionality.

The `KeyValuePipe` was created to address this issue. It transforms an Object or a Map into an array of key-value pairs so we can use `ngFor` on it.

Letâ€™s see how we can use it:

The result of the pipeâ€™s conversion looks like this:

Letâ€™s see how we can use it with `Map`.

By default, the output array will be ordered by keys (Unicode point value). Here are examples of arrays that were created based on the default alphanumerical order:

But you can always override that by passing a `compareFn` as the second input, if you need a custom ordering.
