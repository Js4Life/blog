In this article, I would like to answer a question that was asked yesterday on Twitter by [Sani Yusuf](https://medium.com/@saniyusuf) and also add more interesting points.



When we dynamically create a component and insert it into the view by using a `ViewContainerRef`, Angular will invoke each one of the lifecycle hooks except for the `ngOnChanges()` hook.

The reason for that is the `ngOnChanges` hook isnâ€™t called when inputs are set programmatically only by the view.

Here is an example for [dynamic](https://netbasal.com/dynamically-creating-components-with-angular-a7346f4a982d) component creation:

So in this case, the answer is Yes, **Angular destroys the component when the parent has been destroyed.**

One more important thing to consider is that if we subscribe manually to a componentâ€™s `@Output()`, we need to clean it by ourselves otherwise weâ€™ll have a [memory leak](https://netbasal.com/why-its-important-to-unsubscribe-from-rxjs-subscription-a7a6455d6a02). For example:

Letâ€™s change the `HelloComponent` and set its change detection to `onPush`Â :

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/34b96a8e1ecfc91ee98f005e7c8d9322.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Now, letâ€™s try to change the `name` input and call `detectChanges()`Â :

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/a1c3199ccb71a20a1a9586527d4ad7a5.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Nothing is happening. But why? Weâ€™re running `detectChanges()` explicitly so it should work, right?

The reason is that weâ€™re running `detectChanges()` on the [**host view**](https://blog.angularindepth.com/working-with-dom-in-angular-unexpected-consequences-and-optimization-techniques-682ac09f6866), not on the component itself and because weâ€™re in `onPush` and setting the input [programmatically](https://netbasal.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-angular-onpush-change-detection-strategy-5bac493074a4) from Angular perspective nothing has changed.

We have two solutions to this problem. We can inject the `CDRef` in our component and call it in the setter:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/8455790f7b16f6be90069d4abc28d8fc.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Or we can get a reference to the component injector:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/2d00c7b44739605672760f95d5c9cf82.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

The above point also happens with non-dynamic components, but the essential point to take from here is that when we call `ref.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` or `ref.hostView.detectChanges()` we are invoking the CDR of the host view.

My friend [Max, Wizard of the Web](https://medium.com/@maxim.koretskyi) also add that if we attach the host view to the `ApplicationRef` (portals, etc.), we need to destroy it manually. For example:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/913edbf1ed494b12d90d193333c22906.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

I will also add that in this case, unlike the first case, we need to call `detectChanges()` in order to invoke the `ngOnInit()`.

### ðŸ”¥ **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
