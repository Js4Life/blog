I donâ€™t usually bother to write about such small things, but Iâ€™ve come across many people who donâ€™t know this handy feature, so I decided I should.

Letâ€™s say we have a `UserModel` interface:

```
interface UserModel {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  address: string;
  phone: string;
}
```

And a `User` class with `update()` method:

```
class User {
  update( user: UserModel ) {
    // Update user
  }
}
```

The problem with the code above is that we must pass an object that implements the whole `UserModel` interface, otherwise typescript will be ðŸ˜¡.

But in our case, we want to be dynamic and not be committed to the entire interface, but still get IntelliSense.

TypeScript (v2.1) provides us with a solution precisely for these casesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠThe `Partial` interface. All we need to do is to change the code above to this:

```
class User {
  update( user: Partial<UserModel> ) {
    // Update user
  }
}
```

Now we can have the best of both worlds.

Another useful example would be if you have a component that takes configuration object as `Input()` and you want to have a default value.

```
type ComponentConfig = {
  optionOne: string;
  optionTwo: string;
  optionThree: string;
}

export class SomeComponent {

  private _defaultConfig: Partial<ComponentConfig> = {
    optionOne: '...'
  }

  @Input() config: ComponentConfig;
  
  ngOnInit() {
    const merged = { ...this._defaultConfig, ...this.config };
  }
}
```

Under the hood the `Partial` interface looks like this:

```
type Partial<T> = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P]; };
```
