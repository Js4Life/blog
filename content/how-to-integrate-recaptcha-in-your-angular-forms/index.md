In this article, we are going to implement from scratch a reCAPTCHA directive for Angular applications including the server side with express js. Along the way, we will use features like custom form controls, async validators, zones and other fun stuff.

#### What is reCAPTCHA

reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse.

We will follow the steps from the official [documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start). I want the use of the directive to be as transparent as possible to the user, so that will be our final result:

### The ClientÂ Side

#### Initialization

First, letâ€™s create the directive.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/752d8beaba0cacab99465f504eb787a7.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

We have three inputs, the public key, a config object for which we have defined an interface, and an optional userâ€™s language.

Our next step is to define the `onloadCallback.` This function will get called when all the dependencies have loaded.

Before we do this, letâ€™s create a method that will insert the reCAPTCHA script.

The code is straightforward. Insert the Javascript resource, setting the `onload` parameter to the name of our `onload` callback function and the `render` parameter to `explicit`.

Now we can implement the `onload` callback (`reCaptchaLoad`).

When the `onload` callback is executed, we can render the container as a reCAPTCHA widget by calling the `grecaptcha.render()` method with the DOM element and the config object.

#### Type Definitions

At this point, typescript will yell at you because you donâ€™t have type definitions for the `grecaptcha` and the `reCaptchaLoad` objects. A quick fix will be to do the following:

#### Create Custom FormÂ Control

As you may know, if you want to create custom form control in Angular, you need to implement the `[ControlValueAccessor](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/ControlValueAccessor-interface.html)` interface. Iâ€™m not going to go into this topic because it requires an article of its own. You can read more about the subject [here](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/07/27/custom-form-controls-in-angular-2.html).

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/6408ab3a89795154069947481b6dd8d3.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

We have implemented the three methods that the `ControlValueAccessor` require. In our case, we donâ€™t care about the `writeValue()` method, so we leave it empty.

Now letâ€™s go back for a second. You remember we defined two callbacks in the final `config` object?

```
'callback': this.onSuccess.bind(this),
'expired-callback': this.onExpired.bind(this)
```

`callback` is the name of your callback function to be executed when the user submits a **successful** CAPTCHA response.

`expired-callback` the name of your callback function to be executed when the recaptcha response **expires** and the user needs to solve a new CAPTCHA.

We need to notify the `formControl` that itâ€™s valid if we get the token from the `onSuccess` function or that itâ€™s invalid if the `onExpired` function is called.

ðŸ’£, surprise! We come across one of Angularâ€™s _unusual_ cases, in which Angular is unconscious and therefore does not run the change detection. Angular doesnâ€™t know about our global callback. Therefore, we need to wrap our code in the `zone.run()` method.

> Running functions via `run` allows you to reenter Angular zone from a task that was executed outside of the Angular zone

#### Add Validators Programmatically

Remember when I said at first that I wanted everything to be as transparent as possible to the user? This is one of the cases.

We need to add the `required` validation to the form control. We can accomplish this by injecting the `NgControl` into our directive to get the `control` instance.

But there is one problem, we canâ€™t inject the `NgControl` into our directive because we have implemented the directive as a `ControlValueAccessor` and because of that Angular will throw an error:

```
Cannot instantiate cyclic dependency! NgControl
```

We can get around this problem by getting the `NgControl` instance directly from the directive `Injector`.

ðŸ˜Ž Now we have the control instance and we can add the `required` validator programmatically. We also need to call the `updateValueAndValidity()` method because calling the `setValidators()` doesnâ€™t trigger any update or value change event.

### The ServerÂ Side

When the user solves a reCAPTCHA, we also need to verify the token with the Google API to ensure that the token is valid. The required parameters are the secret key and the token. Letâ€™s use `[express](https://expressjs.com/)` for this task.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/d6a10a825344574c4e9a63c4cbb23f66.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

The response will be:

```
{
  "success": true|false,
  "challenge_ts": timestamp,
  "hostname": string
  "error-codes": [...]
}
```

In our case, we only care about the `success` key. Letâ€™s add an async validator that will send the HTTP request to our endpoint with the `token` and will set the `control` status based on the response. Iâ€™m going to use the DI for getting the endpoint from our consumer.

I already wrote a dedicated article on how to implement async validators in Angular, you can find it [here](https://netbasal.com/angular-2-forms-create-async-validator-directive-dd3fd026cb45). In a nutshell, if we have a `success` response we are returning `null` to notify the `control` that itâ€™s `valid` otherwise we are returning the `error` object.

We also need to add the validator to the directive `providers` â€”

```
@Directive({ 
   selector: '[nbRecaptcha]', 
   providers: [ ReCaptchaAsyncValidator ]
})
```

And to provide the endpoint in our `signin` component â€”

```
@Component({
  ...
  providers: [{
    provide: RECAPTCHA_URL,
    useValue: 'http://localhost:3000/validate_captcha'
  }]
})
export class SigninComponent { }
```

The last thing is to trigger the validation in our reCAPTCHA directive.

When we get a valid token, we need to add the async validator to the `control` validators that will trigger our HTTP request and based on the response will set the control status.
