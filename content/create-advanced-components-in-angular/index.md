In this article, we are going to learn how to create a dynamic component that uses `ng-content`. We are going to learn advanced techniques like how to create an injector and passing `TemplateRef` or a `Component` as content.

To demonstrate all this, we will create a tooltip. Our final result will be the following:

#### Build the Tooltip Component

First, we need to create the component UI. We will use `ng-content` so that the user can pass a dynamic content.

In the end, we will dynamically create this component through the tooltip directive, so let‚Äôs stop here and build the directive (we will come back to this component later).

#### Build the Tooltip Directive

If you are not familiar with the basics of creating components dynamically in Angular, I highly recommend stopping here and reading my article‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[Dynamically Creating Components With Angular](https://netbasal.com/dynamically-creating-components-with-angular-a7346f4a982d).

What we need to do now is to listen to the `mouseenter` event and create the tooltip component.

We see **two** new parameters that we did not discuss in the previous article.

#### Injector ‚Äî

We can use the `resolveAndCreate()` method, which resolves an array of providers and creates an injector from those providers. The `config` parameter is the same as `@ngModule.providers`.

In our case, we pass an object with only one property, the `host` element, so we can calculate the tooltip position. In real life, you will pass more things, such as the tooltip placement, animation, etc.

Note that we can pass the same object as an `Input()` to the tooltip component, for instance:

```
this.componentRef.instance.config = config
```

but we want to avoid dealing with errors like _‚ÄúEXCEPTION: Expression has changed after it was checked.‚Äù_

Now we can use the injector providers in our tooltip component and calculate the tooltip position.

Pay attention to the technique we use to grab the¬†`.tooltip-container`. We are leveraging directives to target the element and query for him with the `@[ViewChild](https://netbasal.com/understanding-viewchildren-contentchildren-and-querylist-in-angular-896b0c689f6e)` decorator that provides an API to obtain the native element.

We are done with the tooltip component, now let‚Äôs see how we can project elements to the `ng-content` tag.

#### ngContent ‚Äî

The fourth parameter is what Angular will pass as `ng-content`. This parameter expects to receive a _two-dimensional_ array of DOM elements. Let‚Äôs see the `generateNgContent()` method.

Handling text ‚Äî

This is the simplest case. We check that our `Input()` is a string and create a text node with the help of the `renderer` service.

Handling TemplateRef ‚Äî

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/24859b17edf0157cb3853df166deaa40.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

We instantiate an Embedded View based on the `TemplateRef`. This will give us reference to a `View` object that has one special property‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`rootNodes`. The `rootNodes` is an array of DOM nodes that are extracted from the template, and that‚Äôs exactly what we need.

Handling Components ‚Äî

We need to create the component, and then we can pass the nativeElement as `ng-content`.

If you want to learn more about `Views` in Angular you can read [this](https://blog.angularindepth.com/exploring-angular-dom-abstractions-80b3ebcfc02) article by [Maxim Koretskyi](https://medium.com/@maxim.koretskyi).

The final step is to remove the component on `mouseout`.
