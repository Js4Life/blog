There are times that you need to render a template recursively. For instance, when you have a page with comments, you need to be able to render nested comments and reuse the same component.

In this short article, we are going to create a component that will take as `Input` comments and will know how to display them recursively.

### The Structure:

This is the JSON structure that we expect to get from our server. For this demonstration, we will make it static. ( you can change this structure to how you prefer it )

### Build the Comments Component

As you can see, we can call our component recursively. We donâ€™t want to render the component when there are no comments, so we need to add the `ngIf` directive. ( not required if you donâ€™t have any styles attached to the host )

### Create the App Component

### ðŸ”¥ **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
