With the new release of the Angular CDK (v7.3.0), the overlay position strategy gets a new cool ability that we can use to help us create context menus with ease.

The positioning strategy now allows for the connected overlayâ€™s origin to be set to a point on the page, rather than a DOM element. This enables implementing right-click context menus easily.

Letâ€™s examine the new functionality by creating a Gmail-style list:

We create a usersâ€™ list, and attach a `contextmenu` event, that invokes the `open()` method, passing it the `event` object and the current user whenever the user right-clicks on a div.

We also create the context menu by using `ng-template`. Later, weâ€™ll see how we can inject it into the overlay.

Letâ€™s continue with the component:

The `open()` method gets the `x` and `y` coordinates from the event object and passes them to the `flexibleConnectTo()` method. We also set the scrollStrategy to `close()` to get the same behavior as in Gmailâ€Šâ€”â€Šclose the menu when the user scrolls the page

The last step is to attach the overlay to the page with the provided `TemplateRef`, which we obtained by using `ViewChild`. We also pass the `context`, which consists of the current user object that we got as the second parameter.

If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the Overlay feature, I recommend reading this article I wrote on the subject:

[**Creating Powerful Components with Angular CDK**  
_Creating Components with Angular CDK Overlay_netbasal.com](https://netbasal.com/creating-powerful-components-with-angular-cdk-2cef53d81cea "https://netbasal.com/creating-powerful-components-with-angular-cdk-2cef53d81cea")[](https://netbasal.com/creating-powerful-components-with-angular-cdk-2cef53d81cea)

Letâ€™s finish by adding the behavior of closing the menu when clicking outside it:

On each click, we check if the current target is NOT the overlay element or contained within it, and if thatâ€™s the case, we close the menu.

### ðŸ”¥ Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
