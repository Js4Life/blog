One of my latest assignments was to develop a custom drop-down component which supports both single and multiple selections.

As always, I will share some tips with you in the hope that you will learn new things.

Let‚Äôs begin by preparing the ground with two key components‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe need a `dato-select` and `dato-option` components.

### #Tip 1

Since it‚Äôs a drop-down that supports multiple selection, I need to add a checkmark that indicates whether an option is selected.

One way to achieve this is by adding a `type` input() and according to its value show and hide the markup.

Yeah, it will work, but the disadvantage of this approach is that we add one more check per option to Angular, so in a dropdown with 10,000 options we added 10,000 more checks, and this is only one `ngIf`; usually it will be accompanied with `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, etc.

In my case performance is very important, so I decided to split the `multi-option` to a different component that inherits from the `single-option` to avoid redundant checks.

Also, there are still parts of the markup that both have in common, so I‚Äôll use template strings to keep my code DRY.

### #Tip 2

The previous change brought with it a new problem. Let‚Äôs say I want to use the `multi-select` dropdown:

This will not work as the `ContentChildren` decorator is looking for `DatoOptionComponent`. If we want a reference to the `option-multi` components we need to add a different `ContentChildren` query.

But now we have to maintain both. Luckily we can solve this more elegantly with the help of Angular DI.

We can tell Angular‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen you need `DatoOptionComponent` use `DatoOptionMultiComponent`.

### #Tip 3

I was not satisfied yet. I wanted to use the same selector‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`dato-option`‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor both single and multiple drop-down components. So I changed the `multi-option` selector to be the same.

But now I have a problem. Angular doesn‚Äôt allow duplicate selectors and throws an error:

> More than one component matched on this element.  
> Make sure that only one component‚Äôs selector can match a given element.

The way I solved it is by leveraging the fact that Angular supports the¬†`:not` CSS selector. (along with other useful [selectors](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive#selector))

Now we can stick with the same selector and add attribute when we need `multi-option`. This feels more appropriate, rather than introducing a brand new selector.

### #Tip 4

The drop-down comes with a search box that is performing an internal search by default. We also need the option to perform a server-side search.

One way to achieve this is to create both an `input()` and `output()`:

But it feels like input is redundant and could be avoided; We can make do with knowing if someone is listening to the `search` event and based on that deciding whether to activate the internal search or not.

Every event emitter maintains a list of its observers. If we have at least one observer, it means that someone is subscribed.
