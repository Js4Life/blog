The `navigator.connection` object contains a read-only property named `[effectiveType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType)`, which returns the effective connection type. That type is determined using a combination of recently observed RTT (round-trip time) and downlink values. (at the time of writing, browser support is [limited](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType#Browser_compatibility))

The effective connection type can be either: `slow-2g`,`2g`,`3g`Â , or `4g`.

By combining the [Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API) Information API with Angular, we can write components that render different elements for different connection speeds. For example, if we observe a slow connection, we can render a placeholder or a lower resolution version of our image or video in order to improve our page loading time.

First, letâ€™s create a nice observable wrapper for the connection `change` event.

The `connection$` observable will notify us of the current `effectiveType` value, both on initial page load and on change.

Letâ€™s create the `connection` component:

The code is straightforward. The connection component is grabbing the provided `slow` and `fast` templates from its view, and rendering the correct template based on the `effectiveType` property.

Letâ€™s see it in action:

This is one way to implement this. It depends on your needs, so for example, you can implement a simple directive that displays a different source based on the connection.

### **ðŸ”¥ Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment for over seven months, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
