RxJS version [6.5.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#650-2019-04-23) is now available. This post highlights the latest features and improvements in this version.

### New Fetch Observable

RxJS now provides built-in support for using the native JS [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API, including the ability to abort requests with `[AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)` baked-in.

### forkJoin Improvements

This is one of my favorites. The `forkJoin` observable now takes a dictionary of sources:

Moreover, there is one deprecationâ€Šâ€”â€Š`forkJoin(a, b, c, d)` should no longer be used; Instead, pass an array such as `forkJoin([a, b, c, d])`.

### Partition Observable

The current `partition` operator is deprecated in favor of a new creation observable, named `partition`.

The [partition](https://netbasal.com/rxjs-eight-operators-worth-getting-to-know-2b6c18e601d) observable splits the source observable into two observables, one for values which satisfy the given predicate, and the other for values which donâ€™t.

### combineLatest Deprecation

This version deprecates all `combineLatest` signatures except `combineLatest([a, b, c])`Â . You can read the reason for this change [here](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/commit/6661c79).

### Schedulers

Add the `scheduled` creation function to create a scheduled observable of values. The scheduled versions of `from`, `range`, et al. have been deprecated.
