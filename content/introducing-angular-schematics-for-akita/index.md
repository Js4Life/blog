`akita-schematics` provides CLI commands for generating files when building new features with Akita. Built on top of Angular [Schematics](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2), this tool integrates with the Angular [CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

Whether you want to add Akita to your application or youâ€™re already using it, you can use `schematics` to streamline the generation of Akita features.

### Installation

Install `akita-schematics` from npm:

```
npm install akita-schematics --save-dev
```

### Default Schematics Collection

To use `akita-schematics` as the default collection in your Angular CLI project,  
add it to your `angular.json` file:

```
ng config cli.defaultCollection akita-schematics
```

The `akita-schematics` extends the default `@schematics/angular` collection.

### Create a NewÂ Feature

```
ng g akita-schematics:feature todos/todos
```

The default command will output an **entity** based feature, but you can also generate a regular one:

```
ng g akita-schematics:feature todos/todos --plain
```

Note that the `akita-schematics:` prefix is only needed when the default collection isnâ€™t set to `akita-schematics`Â .

### Generate aÂ Store

```
ng g akita-schematics:store todos
ng g akita-schematics:entity-store todos

Alias:
ng g akita-schematics:as todos
ng g akita-schematics:aes todos
```

### Generate aÂ Query

```
ng g akita-schematics:query todos
ng g akita-schematics:entity-query todos

Alias:
ng g akita-schematics:aq todos
ng g akita-schematics:aeq todos
```
