In this article, we will learn how to create components in Angular dynamically.

First, we need a component.

For the simplicity, we are going to use a simple `alert` component that will take as `Input` the alert type.

Next, If you think about it, eventually components are DOM elements so when you need to add an element, you need a place to ‚Äúput‚Äù it.

In Angular, this place is called a **container**.

In the `my-app` component, we are creating a template element. We are also using the hash symbol (#) to declare a reference variable named `alertContainer`. The `template` element is the **place**, or in the Angular world, the **container**.

**Note:** The container can be any DOM element or component.

Now we need to get a reference to our `template` element in the `my-app` component.

We can get a reference to the `template` element with the `ViewChild` decorator that also takes a local variable as a parameter.

The default return from the `ViewChild` decorator is the component instance or the DOM element, but in our case, we need to get the element as `ViewContainerRef`.

As the name suggests, `[ViewContainerRef](https://netbasal.com/angular-2-understanding-viewcontainerref-acc183f3b682#.rf5f05b5p)` is a reference to a **container**. `ViewContainerRef` stores a reference to the `template` element ( our container ) and also exposes an API to create components.

Let‚Äôs add two buttons that will help us to create the `alert` component.

Before we proceed to the `createComponent()` method, we need to add one more service.

The `ComponentFactoryResolver` service exposes one primary method, `resolveComponentFactory`.

The `resolveComponentFactory()` method takes a component and returns a `ComponentFactory`.

You can think of `ComponentFactory` as an object that knows how to create a component.

As you can see the `ComponentFactory` exposes the `create()` method that will be used by the **container** ( ViewContainerRef ) internally.

Now for the final step.

Let‚Äôs explain what is happening piece by piece.

Every time we need to create the component we need to remove the previous view, otherwise, it will append more components to the container. (not required if you need multiple components)

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/0a19b30850e6f3454e779910a0145d87.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

The `resolveComponentFactory()` method takes a component and returns the recipe for how to create a component.

We are calling the `createComponent()` method with the recipe. Internally this method will call the `create()` method from the factory and will append the component as a **sibling** to our container.

Now we have a reference to our new component, and we can set the type `Input`.

You can also subscribe to a component `Output` like this:

And don‚Äôt forget to destroy the component:

The last step is to add your dynamic components to the [entryComponents](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule-faq#what-is-an-entry-component) section:
