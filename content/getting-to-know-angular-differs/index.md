Angular differs are probably the least known APIs; These are highly optimized building blocks used by Angular itself throughout the framework (ngClass, ngStyle, ngFor, etc.).

You certainly wonâ€™t use them on a daily basis, however, given the right circumstances, they can prove to be very useful. If you ever get to the point where youâ€™re saying to yourself:

> Itâ€™s not enough for me to know that something has changed, I want to know what hasÂ changed.

Then you should know that Angular differs is the answer.

Angular offers two types of differs APIs, one is the `IterableDiffer` and the second is the `KeyValueDiffers`.

### The IterableDiffer API

`IterableDiffer` is an API that tracks changes made to an iterable over time and also exposes an API enabling you to react to these changes.

Letâ€™s learn how we can use it by creating our own `ngClass` directive.

The `find()` method checks whether Angular has a differ that supports the type of the given parameter. We can examine this process in the source code:

Once found, the `create()` method returns an instance of this differ, in this case `DefaultKeyValueDiffer`Â .

Great, we have a differ. Now letâ€™s see how we can use it. Our goal is to listen for any change in the `ngMyClass` input, and based on that adding or removing the class.

We can check for changes by calling the `diff()` method with the new value.

When there arenâ€™t any changes the return value will be null, otherwise the return value will be an object that exposes self-explanatory methods that we can use to react to these changes.

In our case, we want to know whether an item was added or removed so we can act accordingly.

### The KeyValueDiffers API

The `KeyValueDiffers` api works in a similar matter, except it tracks the changes in an object rather than an iterable.

The same concepts mentioned in the first section also apply here. Letâ€™s change the directive we created to get an object instead of an array:

When using `KeyValueDiffers` the `find()` and `create()` method implementations are the following:

Now that we have a differ, letâ€™s use it:

Same as before. When we donâ€™t get null, we have handy self-explanatory methods that give us all what we need.
