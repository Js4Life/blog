One of the new capabilities in `ngrx` version 4 is a lazy load for reducers.

I’m not going to show or explain the code now because this is still in development. I will update the article when the version is released.

But nevertheless I did want to share with you the code so you can play with it.

Just clone the [repository](https://github.com/NetanelBasal/ngrx4-lazy-load), start the application, open your console and inspect the chunk’s content.

😇 have fun!
