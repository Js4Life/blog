This post assumes that you at least have some working knowledge of ngrx/store and RxJS.

In this article, we are going to learn how we can query normalized state in our redux store.

Letâ€™s say we have a blog and our normalized state look like this:

First letâ€™s create our smart component.

Iâ€™m going to abstract the `queries` to a dedicated service for three reasons:

1.  I do not like the idea of injecting the `Store` into my component. The component does not need to know how he gets the data. ( For the same reason that you do not inject the `HTTP` service. )
2.  I want the ability to reuse my `queries` in any other parts of my application.
3.  I want to keep my component clean.

Now letâ€™s create the `ArticlesQuery`Â .

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/9abf5e5e3d932c7732ec07beb98fd57a.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

First, we need to create a dedicated selector for every part of the state so that we can compose them later.

Now letâ€™s say we have a place in the app that needs only the articles. (`aside` area for example)

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/361ee8e13e8e231466c2ee96862e482e.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

The `result` and `articles` depend on each other ( if we add new article we need to update both the `result` and the `articles` ), so our best choice is to use the `[zip](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/zip.md)` operator.

> After all observables emit, emit values as anÂ array

We can also use the second parameterâ€Šâ€”â€Š`resultSelector`. A function which takes the inputs at the specified index and combines them together.

`combineLatest` will also work but I prefer `zip` in this case.

**_update:_** `**_combineLatest_**` **_is a better option._**

Now letâ€™s say we need the `articles` with their `comments`.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/36bd25166644848ea3b02900418519ba.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Do you see where Iâ€™m going with this? We can compose `queries` to get the necessary data.

Now letâ€™s say we need the `articles` with their `comments` and the `authors`.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/8ba81e3a920b8e8eea8a2c2641be8425.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Now letâ€™s add a `selectedArticle` key to our state.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/0539573f83d5f460b23402d6633cfc25.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

If we want to display the selected article we can use the `[withLatestFrom](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/withlatestfrom.md)` operator.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/adfdca3f858ecddd0b74c8e04bcc1738.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

> Also provide the last value from another observable

When the `selectedArticle` changes our observable emits new value with the latest `articles` and our component will re-render.

If we need only the `article` without any other data we can do this:

#### Angular Router

The Router `params` are an observable so for example, if we store the selected id in the URL we can query the article like this:

#### Form Control

The `valueChanges` property is an observable, so for example if we need to implement search we can do this like this:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/fa4d8e51cd2884fa7ebe81ad879c7020.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Letâ€™s say you need to get the favorite articles of a user, and this information is stored in a `user` reducer.

### You donâ€™t needÂ [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)

The `select()` method will give you an observable that calls `[distinctUntilChanged](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/distinctuntilchanged.md)()` internally, meaning they will only fire when the state actually **changes**. ( it means when there is a new reference ).

### Summary

In the end, you have to remember that everything is a **stream**. You can use various observables/operators to compose data from your state or any other source.

`[combineLatest](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/combinelatest.md)`Â , `[withLatestFrom](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/withlatestfrom.md)`Â , `[zip](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/zip.md)`, `[concat](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/concat.md)`Â , `[forkJoin](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/forkjoin.md)`Â ,`[merge](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/merge.md)` and moreâ€¦

### ðŸ”¥ **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment for over seven months, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
