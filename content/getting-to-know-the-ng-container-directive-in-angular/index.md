In many cases when working on your app, you forced to wrap your content with an additional tag when using structural directives.

Letâ€™s see a few examples.

#### \- Using `ngIf` to wrap multipleÂ nodes:

In the above example, we are forced to add additional tag because we want to use one `ngIf` for both divs.

This is not the best solution for two reasons:

1.  We are adding unnecessary DOM node.
2.  Thatâ€™s maybe screwed our styles.

One way to get around this is to use the de-sugared version syntax of structural directives.

Thatâ€™s fine, but we are not using the asterisk anymore, and this leads to inconsistency in our code.

The second solution is the `**ng-container**` directive.

> <ng-container> is a logical container that can be used to group nodes but is not rendered in the DOM tree as aÂ node.

> <ng-container> is rendered as an HTMLÂ comment.

So now we can do this:

Nice!

#### \- Use ngSwitch:

Sometimes we need to display text based on the switch statement. The problem is that this forces us to add an additional tag. For example:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/3b906620eb12590dc28776ffb8d2d6ab.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

But in many cases, we donâ€™t need the additional tag (in this case the `span`). Letâ€™s use `ng-container` to solve this problem:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/20b1ad77ccc1be9c644567d5a552fd81.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Now our template is clean!

### ðŸ”¥ **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
