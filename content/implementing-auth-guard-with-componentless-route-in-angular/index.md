I see a lot of different implementations of Auth Guards around the web.Â   
The implementation is quite simple. In most cases, you will find yourself doing something like this:

And then you will add the guard to any protected route.

As you see, we need to repeat the same line of code whenever there is a new protected route. Of course, itâ€™s not the end of the world, but we can do better and not write redundant configuration.

Letâ€™s use a `componentless` route as a parent. `Componentless` routes consume URL segments without instantiating components.

> Componentless routes are useful when the same configuration apply to all childÂ routes

For example guards, resolvers, params, etc.,

Now letâ€™s see how we can achieve the same thing with a `componentless` route.

And we also need to change the method name in our guard.

Now every time you navigate to `/todos` or `/blog` route, the `AuthGuard` will run. ðŸ˜Ž

You can also achieve the same thing in Angular version 4 with the following code:

And thatâ€™s how it looks with lazy-load routes:

### ðŸ”¥ **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard ofÂ Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that weâ€™ve developed here in Datorama. Itâ€™s been successfully used in a big data production environment, and weâ€™re continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
