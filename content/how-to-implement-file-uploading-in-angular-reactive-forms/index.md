In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through the process of creating a reactive form that includes a file upload, along with the normal form fields. Along the way, we‚Äôll create a custom form control for our file input, add validation and create custom RxJS operators.

Our demo will include a simple sign up form with a single text field, for the user‚Äôs email, and an upload file field, where we‚Äôll require the user to upload a profile photo.

Here is an illustration of the final result:

Let‚Äôs get started.

### Creating the¬†Form

First let‚Äôs create the sign-up form:

We‚Äôve created a form group that contains the `email` and `image`, and defined both as required. In addition to that, for the image control, we added a custom validation for the file type. We‚Äôll see the implementation of this validator later on.

### Creating the File Upload Component

Let‚Äôs continue with the file upload component:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/30e036ef74e274ca1529716d75a43138.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

We registered a `change` event listener that emits the files that the user uploads. In our case we‚Äôre interested only in one file, so we‚Äôll use the `item()` method, passing the first index to obtain a reference to it.

We also have a progress component that‚Äôs responsible for the loading progress UI (code omitted for the sake of brevity).

### Creating a Custom Form¬†Control

At this point, we have a problem. Angular doesn‚Äôt come with a built-in value accessor for file input, so we‚Äôll get the following error:

> Error: No value accessor for form control with name: ‚Äòimage‚Äô

What Angular means is that it doesn‚Äôt know how to connect our component to the form API. Let‚Äôs inform Angular on how to do that by creating a custom value accessor:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/87b6811039eb45e5286e8b3922da2af7.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

I‚Äôm not going to get into the details of what actually happens here because I have an article dedicated to this topic:

[**Angular Custom Form Controls Made Easy**  
_Imagine that you need to implement an auto-expand textarea for one of your forms._netbasal.com](https://netbasal.com/angular-custom-form-controls-made-easy-4f963341c8e2 "https://netbasal.com/angular-custom-form-controls-made-easy-4f963341c8e2")[](https://netbasal.com/angular-custom-form-controls-made-easy-4f963341c8e2)

The important thing to note here is that upon file change we set the control value to be the chosen file, and that whenever we call `control.patchValue(null)` or `control.reset()` we‚Äôre clearing the file input.

Let‚Äôs see what we get by listening to the form‚Äôs `valueChanges` event:

Great, our `image` control contains the file data.

### Creating a Custom Validation

As we saw earlier, we want to create a custom validator that allows uploading only files with the `png` file extension:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/267f7bfb94e67c08c170a190553fdadf.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Whenever the user uploads a file, we return a `true` (invalid) value if its extension is not the same as the one we defined in the validator. Otherwise we return `null`, which indicates that the validation passed.

I‚Äôve omitted the code that shows the errors for the sake of brevity. If you want to learn how you can magically show a control‚Äôs errors, read the following article:

[**Make Your Angular Form‚Äôs Error Messages Magically Appear**  
_In this article, we‚Äôre going to learn how to develop a generic method that displays validation errors in Angular‚Äôs‚Ä¶_netbasal.com](https://netbasal.com/make-your-angular-forms-error-messages-magically-appear-1e32350b7fa5 "https://netbasal.com/make-your-angular-forms-error-messages-magically-appear-1e32350b7fa5")[](https://netbasal.com/make-your-angular-forms-error-messages-magically-appear-1e32350b7fa5)

### Send it to the¬†Server

We‚Äôve reached the point where we have the information we need, so now it‚Äôs time to send it to our server. Let‚Äôs implement the `submit` method:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/be0e816fe4caa5fb9a01ba7f75099a52.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

First, we need to use the `[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)` API in order to construct an object containing the selected value‚Äôs fields, so that they can be sent to the server via Ajax.

We create a pure and reusable function that takes an object, in our case the form value, and returns a `FormData` instance containing it:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/e4655cce5e8e43c92077f12b54256cd2.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Next, we want to get notified about the progress of the upload, so we need to set the `reportProgress` option to true and the `observe` option to `events`.

We then subscribe to our observable to initiate the request, and listen to the different event types over the course of the request lifecycle. Now we can react appropriately depending on the event type.

It‚Äôs worth noting that in real life we‚Äôd opt to use a service rather than using the HTTP service directly in the component.

### Room for Improvement

I want to take the code a step further and make it reusable, and also write it in a reactive way. Let‚Äôs create two custom operators to make that possible:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/f80e43f1f39602b4cb55f25b84783ac2.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Building your own operator is as simple as writing a function which takes a source `observable` as an input and returns an output stream. We can compose forms by seamlessly adding our custom operator to other operators.

Now we can modify the existing code as follows:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/a4602081fe3b4fa4089280dea8ae6a87.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Much better.

### The Server¬†Endpoint

We‚Äôll conclude by showing an example of our server endpoint. In this case, we‚Äôll use Node and express, but the client-side code will work with any server-side implementation.

### üî• **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard of¬†Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that we‚Äôve developed here in Datorama. It‚Äôs been successfully used in a big data production environment, and we‚Äôre continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
