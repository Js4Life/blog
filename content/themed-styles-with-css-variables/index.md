If you worked with a tool like SASS/LESS to gain themes support in your apps, you must know that this is not an easy task.

CSS variables, or more accurately, as they are called in the [spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/), CSS custom properties, can be useful for creating **_themes_**.

This will not be an introduction to CSS variables; you can read more about them [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/css-variables-why-should-you-care).

We can define different values for every theme. Now the only thing to do is to apply the class to our body in **_runtime_** with JavaScript, and we are done.
