With every article I publish, my goal is to help you become a better and more confident coder.

Here are a couple of pointers to help shed some light on Angular Forms:

### Control Validation

By default, whenever a value of a `FormControl` changes, Angular runs the control validation process.

For example, if you have an input that is bound to a form control, Angular performs the control validation process for _every_ keystroke.

Let‚Äôs see this in action:

![](./asset-2.gif)

Now, imagine a form with complex validation requirements‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääupdating such a form on every keystroke could become too costly. In addition to that, I find it very annoying to display an error message to the user when he hasn‚Äôt completed the action of entering the form data.

The way we get around this is by using the `updateOn` property. We can tell Angular that we only want to run the validation function upon `submit` or `blur`. As we saw, the default option is upon `change`.

![`updateOn: ‚Äòblur‚Äô`](./asset-3.gif)

We can also apply this option to a `formGroup` or a `formArray`.

---

Ok, that‚Äôs great. But let‚Äôs say we still want to run our validators whenever form control‚Äôs data changes, how can we optimize them?

In such a case we don‚Äôt have to use the control validator mechanism, we can create an alternative which we can fully control ourselves.

Luckily, every control exposes a `valueChanges` observable that we can take advantage of, and use RxJS to do some more powerful stuff. For example, we can add a `debounce` to our control.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/cce51a297f5b6079879628bf8267fd6a.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

And this is only one simple example. We can use more powerful operators to perform advanced cross-control validations like `merge`, `combineLatest`, etc., so keep that in mind.

**I also wanted to mention that I‚Äôm against** [**premature optimization**](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization)‚Äî you should always prefer readability and reusability, and only apply optimizations when you think you may need them.

---

There might be cases when we don‚Äôt want to invalidate the form just because a single control is invalid. I haven‚Äôt come across such a case, but maybe you have.

In such a case the message you‚Äôre trying to convey to the user is: ‚Äúthis value isn‚Äôt valid, but it doesn‚Äôt mean the form can‚Äôt be submitted‚Äù.

In this instance we can set the `onlySelf` property to true, which means that each change only affects the control itself alone, and not its parents.

### Preventing Infinite¬†Loops

In the process of setting up our form controls, we might inadvertently cause infinite loops.

For example, if on the one hand we listen to the store‚Äôs changes and update the form accordingly, and on the other hand we listen to the form‚Äôs value changes and update the store.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/3b487f1615419121573382914eec104f.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

In order to avoid the above situation, we can tell Angular not to emit the `valueChanges` event whenever we update the form.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/e451fdce23ef4bd263dbe1002bff47da.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

And now we‚Äôre good to go. It is worth noting that most of a control‚Äôs methods support this option, such as `setValue()`, `reset(), updateValueAndValidity()`, etc.

### Control Disabling

As you may know, when we need to disable or enable a control we can call the `control.disable()` or `control.enable()` methods.

That‚Äôs helpful, but sometimes we want to tell Angular that this control is `disabled` on the initialization face. We can achieve this by passing an object to our `FormControl` constructor.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/1e452f627caf8ac8b36cb69061625ab3.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Pay attention that we must also pass the `value` property; otherwise Angular assumes that we want the control‚Äôs value to be `{ disabled: true }`.

---

My next tip is something I think many people haven‚Äôt noticed yet. Whenever we call a control‚Äôs `disable()` or `enable()` methods, Angular triggers the `valueChanges` event.

Yes, it may surprise you because the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù didn‚Äôt change, but this is how it works.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/42877265ecff6e0cfa907fd16719bf72.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

There are times when we want to prevent this behavior from occurring.

Let‚Äôs say we need to update the store upon form‚Äôs value changes. This behavior would cause redundant updates, since we‚Äôd also update the store whenever the control disability status changed.

Luckily as we mentioned before there is an easy fix, we can add `{ emitEvent false }` to the current method:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/77e5292e732253d22e93114aad435ea0.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

---

When we want to get our `FormGroup` value we usually call the `value` property. For example:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/be1923c9e504ae1356a8c20aaec9d040.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

But there‚Äôs one catch there. The `value` property will omit controls that are disabled. So, in the above example, we‚Äôll only get the `email` control value.

In most cases, this is not the desired behavior. In order to get the complete form‚Äôs values, we can use the `FormGroup.getRawValue()` method.

### Control Getters and¬†Setters

I want to talk about a common mistake that I see in people‚Äôs code examples, especially on Stackoverflow. When they need to add a new control, they assign it directly to the parent‚Äôs controls property:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/4eacd21d265ece705c36b9ee3b806c25.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Please don‚Äôt do this. Instead, use the `addControl()` method, since it performs multiple required tasks for us under the hood:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/c8d71d243b42bd56e20d868589f00115.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="Angular source code" />

---

Another thing I want to talk about is obtaining a reference to a form control. This is more of a personal stylistic preference, but I don‚Äôt like to get it from the group‚Äôs controls property:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/80b36f636df351785d925df00068cc65.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Angular provides the group with a `get()` method, and I find it to be a more preferable option.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/1772f3f055a28d783e0dee4c0c2b5908.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Another reason to prefer this‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Angular team might opt to change the `FormGroup` structure in the future, and if we use the `controls` property directly, it might lead to a breaking change, whereas the `get()` method could adjust to reflect the new structure.

This might be why Angular provides us with the `get()` method, but hey, maybe it‚Äôs just me.

### Using FormBuilder

There are times when we need to create a large form structure. In this case, the code can rapidly become repetitive and full of boilerplate. For example:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/dd4df81d213b9c2faf7de553b030ad2a.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

In reality, it might be even larger than that, but you get the point. In order to make our life easier, Angular provides us with the `FormBuilder` service, which frees us from adding boilerplate. I think it‚Äôs a better option, as it enables much cleaner code.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/0cee3190cfa9774c51af1edde8241bb4.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

That‚Äôs it üòÄ

### **üòç Last but Not Least, Have you Heard of¬†Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that we‚Äôve developed here in Datorama. It‚Äôs been successfully used in a big data production environment, and we‚Äôre continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
