This post assumes that you at least have some working knowledge of Angular reactive forms.

Letâ€™s say this is our structure:

We need to transform this to an Angular form. Our goal is to render a list of skills with a checkbox that will be un/checked based on the `selected` key from each skill.

Letâ€™s create the form:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/72a44d911a05cdfc14f8cf88fd01238b.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Our form is just a group with one keyâ€Šâ€”â€Š`skills`.

The `buildSkills()` method is responsible for â€”

1.  Create an array of `FormControls` with an initial value based on the `selected` key from each skill.
2.  Pass the array to the `FormArray`.

Letâ€™s stop for a second and recognize the final structure without the `form builder`.

Now we can write the HTML.

The code is straightforward. We are just looping over the skills **controls** and binding each skill to a checkbox.

**_Tip_**_: We can use the_ `_index_` _to show additional information, for example, the skill name._

The final step is to map the form value to something that we can send to our server.
