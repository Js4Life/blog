In this article, we‚Äôll learn how to create a powerful drop-down component with the help of structural directives.

Before you start, I highly recommend reading my article‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[The Power of Structural Directives in Angular](https://netbasal.com/the-power-of-structural-directives-in-angular-bfe4d8c44fb1).

We aren‚Äôt going to waste time on styling. We‚Äôll take the CSS bootstrap [dropdown](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns) style.

This will be our final result:

Let‚Äôs start with creating the component. I will omit the CSS classes so that we can focus on the important things.

We need a way to inject custom templates from outside one for the selected option and one for each option.

Let‚Äôs create two structural directives that will help us with this.

For the selected option:

For each option:

Nothing fancy here, we are just injecting the `TemplateRef` in both directives so that we can use them later in the parent component. Notice that in the `NbSelectOptionDirective` we also take as `Input` the option.

Now we can use them in our component.

We don‚Äôt need additional HTML tags, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre using `[ng-container](https://netbasal.com/getting-to-know-the-ng-container-directive-in-angular-a97b7a33c8ea)`[.](https://netbasal.com/getting-to-know-the-ng-container-directive-in-angular-a97b7a33c8ea) We‚Äôll return soon to the `let-selected` part.

Now let‚Äôs get a reference to these directives in the `nb-dropdown` component and render the templates in the appropriate places.

We can use the `@[ContentChild](https://netbasal.com/understanding-viewchildren-contentchildren-and-querylist-in-angular-896b0c689f6e)` and `@[ContentChildren](https://netbasal.com/understanding-viewchildren-contentchildren-and-querylist-in-angular-896b0c689f6e)` decorators to get a reference to the directives instances. Now we can use them in our template.

We can use the `[ngTemplateOutlet](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgTemplateOutlet-directive.html)` directive to embed a view from a prepared `TemplateRef` and the `ngOutletContext` input to pass a context to the embedded view ( this is for the `let-selected` part ). We also add an `Input` for a placeholder.

The last thing is to create a custom form control for our component.

As you may know, if you want to create custom form control in Angular, you need to implement the `[ControlValueAccessor](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/ControlValueAccessor-interface.html)` interface. I‚Äôm not going to go into this topic because it requires an article of its own. You can read more about the subject [here](https://netbasal.com/angular-custom-form-controls-made-easy-4f963341c8e2).

Now let‚Äôs see the final component but this time we the syntactic sugar syntax.

### Summary

We saw how we could create a powerful component with the help of structural directives. We‚Äôve implemented only the basic of our dropdown, but you can take it from here to do anything that you need.

If you lack an understanding of any part of the article you can find the answer in the article I mentioned at the beginning.

### üëÇüèª **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard of¬†Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that we‚Äôve developed here in Datorama. It‚Äôs been successfully used in a big data production environment for over seven months, and we‚Äôre continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
