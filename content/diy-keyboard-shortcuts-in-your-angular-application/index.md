So your new product manager‚Äôs request is to add keyboard shortcuts for common actions in the application, giving the users a fast and slick experience.

As a good developer, you don‚Äôt want to reinvent the wheel. The initial instinct tells you to google for something like ‚Äúangular hotkeys‚Äù and find an existing library that will do the work for you.

But wait! Before you add a few extra kilobytes to your bundle and give your browser‚Äôs engine additional code to parse, let me show you how you can do it yourself by using a built-in Angular API.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Events¬†Magic

There is a lesser-known API which provides us with the ability to combine multiple [keys](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/events/key_events.ts#L24) when registering a keyboard event through Angular APIs.

For example, here‚Äôs how we can define an event that‚Äôs triggered only when the user presses `cmd` and `k` at the same time:

We are not limited to two keys; we can combine as many as we like:

### ü¶ä That‚Äôs Nice, However..

When we have one or two shortcuts in the application, we can make do with this functionality. Since we‚Äôve got dozens in our real-world application, we‚Äôll take it a step further.

We want to create an abstraction for the application shortcuts. We need this abstraction to serve as the repository for all the shortcut logic, enabling us to control and modify it from there, and display it to the user if needed.

Next, we‚Äôll ‚Äúobservify‚Äù the current API, giving us the power of RxJS.

Let‚Äôs create the `Hotkeys` service:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/405e8127ef5101c24b35a539f54461ae.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

We obtain a reference to the `EventKeyManager` provider via DI. This provider exposes the `addEventListener()` method, where we can register the required event.

Alternatively, we can also use the Renderer provider `listen()` method. However, since we can‚Äôt inject it in a service, we‚Äôll need to create a new instance of it ourselves, something which I prefer to avoid.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this provider, you can read one of my previous detailed article about this topic:

[**Lifting the Veil: Insights into Angular‚Äôs EventManagerPlugin**  
_Getting to know the EventManagerPlugin in Angular_netbasal.com](https://netbasal.com/lifting-the-veil-insights-into-angulars-eventmanagerplugin-ed9d14cbb31a "https://netbasal.com/lifting-the-veil-insights-into-angulars-eventmanagerplugin-ed9d14cbb31a")[](https://netbasal.com/lifting-the-veil-insights-into-angulars-eventmanagerplugin-ed9d14cbb31a)

We create the `addShortcut()` method that receives the element ( which default to `document` ) and the key combo, and returns an observable that registers the event when we subscribe.

Now, we can use the service wherever we want:

The next thing we need to do is to open a modal where we show the available shortcuts to the users. We‚Äôll do so by registering a new shortcut, `shift +¬†?`, that opens the modal, and provide the consumer with the option to pass a description for each shortcut:

We create a new `hotkeys` property, which is a `Map` where the `key` is the shortcut key combo, and the `value` is the description. Now we can pass this data into our modal and display it to our users:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/b6ca39bf8fae5e53784d4105217c3c32.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="" />

Let‚Äôs see the `HotkeysHelpComponent` implementation:

We convert the data into an array, so we can iterate over it and elegantly display it in a table. In real life, don‚Äôt forget to take care of windows/mac different key handling.

More improvements that can be made include creating a directive use along with the service, and showing the user the keyboard symbols. Here‚Äôs the list for your convenience:

### Summary

We‚Äôve learned how Angular can simplify our lives and provides us with a useful built-in functionality to create keyboard shortcuts for our application. In most cases, you can make do with this API. If you need more advanced functionality, you can use a third-party library.

### üòç **Have You Tried Akita¬†Yet?**

One of the leading state management libraries, Akita has been used in countless production environments. It‚Äôs constantly developing and improving.

Whether it‚Äôs entities arriving from the server or UI state data, Akita has custom-built stores, powerful tools, and tailor-made plugins, which help you manage the data and negate the need for massive amounts of boilerplate code. We/I highly recommend you try it out.
