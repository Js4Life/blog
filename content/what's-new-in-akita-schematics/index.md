Itâ€™s now easier than ever to add Akita to an Angular project. A single command, and youâ€™ll have the core library, schematics, Akitaâ€™s dev-tools, and the router store at your disposal. Just run:

```
ng add @datorama/akita 
```

And youâ€™re done!

You can include the router store by adding the `withRouter` flag.

### A NewÂ Flag

In addition, when you generate a new **entity** feature, you can also tell Akita to create a module and a component giving you everything you need.
