Higher order observables are one of the most influential features in Rx. Theyâ€™re also one of the most difficult to understand.

In this article, I will try to explain the subject in my own way. Hopefully, it will shine some light in the dark.

Letâ€™s say you have a simple task. You have a button, and when you click on it, you need to start an interval. Letâ€™s see how we would implement this the simple way.

We need to subscribe to the `fromEvent()` observable, which internally adds a new click event listener to our button. When the user clicks on the button, we need to subscribe to the `interval()` observable, which internally invokes the native JS `setInterval()` function.

While it works fine, there are two drawbacks to the code above.  
1\. Itâ€™s starting to look like [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/).Â   
2\. We need to handle the disposal of every subscription by ourselves.

Letâ€™s see how higher order observables make things easier for us.

### Higher Order Observables

An observable can emit values of any type: numbers, strings, objects, etc. This means an observable can also emit values that are, themselves, observables too.

A higher order observable is just a fancy name for an observable that emits observable. Letâ€™s change the example a little bit so you can see what Iâ€™m talking about.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/b6f807c138b150545690bca8c9770ca0.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="clicks$ to interval$" />

When the user clicks on the button, we leverage the `map()` operator to return an `interval()` observable to the stream.

When we subscribe, the `clicks$` observable will `next()` an interval observable.

![Clicking multipleÂ times](./asset-3.gif)

You may notice that, in this case, we never invoke the interval. In contrast, in the first example, we saw the numbers running in the console.

Thatâ€™s because we **never called subscribe() on our** `**interval$**` **observable**. Remember that observables are **lazy**â€Šâ€”â€Šif we want to pull a value out of an observable, we must `subscribe()`.

Now, we are going to once again see the numbers from our interval observable.

Now that we understand the nature of higher order observables, letâ€™s introduce two useful operators to help us with the problems mentioned above.

### mergeAll

> _When the inner observable emits, let me know by merging the value to the outer observable._

Under the hood, the `mergeAll()` operator basically does what we did in the last example. It takes the inner observable, subscribes to it, and pushes the value to the observer.

_In our case, the source ( or outer ) observable is the_ `_clicks$_` _observable and the inner observable is the_ `_interval$_` _observable._

Because this is a common pattern in Rx, there is a shortcut that achieves the same behaviourâ€Šâ€”â€Š`mergeMap()`.

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/887f9c4f73c55371671bbc44b2051f0d.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="mergeMaP" />

So `mergeMap()` is just `map()` + `mergeAll()`.

Hereâ€™s a very basic implementation of `mergeMap()`:

<Embed src="https://gist.github.com/NetanelBasal/123170d981bd160e4b7866c62e56e1f0.js" aspectRatio={0.357} caption="mergeMap" />

From the above code, we can learn that each time we click on the button, we are invoking the `subscribe()` method of the inner `interval()` observableâ€Šâ€”â€Š**which leads to multiple independent intervals in our page.**

If this is what youâ€™re after, you are good to go. But, if you want to cancel the previous subscriptions and keep only one, youâ€™ll need the `switch()` operator.

### switch

> _Like mergeMap() but when the source observable emits cancel any previous subscriptions of the inner observable._

As the name suggests, `switch()` switches to the new subscription and cancels the previous one.

If we change our code to `switch()` and click on the button multiple times, weâ€™ll see that each time we click we are given a new `interval` and the previous one is **canceled**.

![Clicking threeÂ times](./asset-4.gif)

As you can see, even after clicking three times, we have only **one** `interval` running. In contrast, with the `merge()` operator, we would have three independent intervals. Essentially, the key difference between `merge()` and `switch()` is one important line.

When the source emits, we need to unsubscribe from the previous inner subscription.

Because this is a common pattern in Rx, there is a shortcut to achieve the same behaviourâ€Šâ€”â€Š`switchMap()`.

So `switchMap()` is just `map()` + `switch()`.

### Summary

We learned about higher order observables and the difference between `mergeMap()` and `switchMap()`. As a rule of thumb, if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing, `switchMap()` is a better choice.
