As you probably know, when we add a service to a `@NgModule()` declaration, it will be a [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Meaning, it will live as long as our application lives. For example:

```
export class AdminService {
  data = Array(10000).fill(dummy);
}

@NgModule({
  providers: [AdminService, AdminDataService]
})
```

I see a lot of people whose first instinct is to just put all their services in `@NgModule()` declarations without thinking about the consequences. The problem with that is:

> _You are not releasing memory_

Although you probably don‚Äôt need this memory anymore. Let‚Äôs stop for a second and think, do we really need this service to be an wide app singleton?

For example, in our application, we have an admin section where we need to display a big list of data which, of course, is stored in memory.

We don‚Äôt need this service to be a singleton. We don‚Äôt need a caching layer, and no one out of this tab needs data from it.

_The sole purpose of the service is to share data between child‚Äôs components and to provide a couple of helper‚Äôs methods._

So, we stick it in the **component** providers and make it a non-singleton service.

```
@Component({
  selector: 'admin-tab',
  providers: [AdminService, AdminDataService]
})
```

The benefit is that when Angular destroyed the component, Angular will also destroy the service and release the memory that is occupied by it.

### OnDestroy Hook

Many developers don‚Äôt know this, but non-singletons services also have the `ngOnDestroy()` lifecycle hook. You can use it for cleaning.

```
export class AdminService implements OnDestroy {

  ngOnDestroy() {
    // Clean subscriptions, intervals, etc
  }  
}
```

Also if we call `NgModuleRef.destroy()` or `PlatformRef.destroy()` then `ngOnDestroy` method of singleton providers will be also [executed](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/674c3def319e2c444823319ae43394d46f3973b7/packages/core/src/view/ng_module.ts#L199-L204).

### üëÇüèª **Last but Not Least, Have you Heard of¬†Akita?**

Akita is a state management pattern that we‚Äôve developed here in Datorama. It‚Äôs been successfully used in a big data production environment for over seven months, and we‚Äôre continually adding features to it.

Akita encourages simplicity. It saves you the hassle of creating boilerplate code and offers powerful tools with a moderate learning curve, suitable for both experienced and inexperienced developers alike.

I highly recommend checking it out.
